The objective is simple: you have to collect the little '!' to increase your score.

You can change your character's color to collect them. Red '!' can only be collected when you are red and idem for the blue ones. 

However your character can't stop to shoot some '+' (if red) or '-' (if blue). Avoid them to stay alive. Only red '+' can hurt you of you're red and idem for the blue '-'.

## Current work

V1.0 is fully playable in both windows and linux.  
I'm currently working on a Android port.
